<h3>recent reads</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom:35px;">Like most people, I'm trying to become a more consistent reader. These are some recent favorites.</p>
<ul>
    <li><p><b><i>The Algebraist</i> by Iain Banks.</b> I love the author's works. The first book I read by the author was The Wasp Factory.</p></li>
</ul>
